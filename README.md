## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Improved problem-solving through hands-on debugging.
- Learned how to plan, build, and refine front-end projects.
- Gained confidence working with core web technologies.

## 🚀 Future Plans
This course has sparked a strong interest in front-end development. I plan to explore JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js, expand into full-stack development, and build applications that are both beautiful and functional.

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me
